## Implementation
### SVM

__Implementation__ : We used pytorch to load and configure the dataset into greyscale vector of size 1x784. We then used sklearn library to train a linear SVM model and a RBF SVM model.

__Best Configuration__ : We tested the RBF model on different magnitudes of C-Values. Looking at online SVM sources allowed us to narrow the test ranges from 10^-1 to 10^2. For the task at hand the best C-Value is around 10 (10^1).

__Model Evaluation__ : The Linear model achieved an accuracy of ~0.917, while the RBF model with the optimal C-Value achieved an accuracy of ~0.987 on the test set. 

__Additional Experiments__ : We tried to graph the RBF function to see better how the model chooses to classify the numbers, but we were not able to properly interpret the large vectors as 2D vectors in a way which makes sense to view.

#### Results

Test Accuracy: ~0.987

__Discussion__ :
For the current task of identifying numbers the SVM RBF model looks a bit superior to the Linear SVM model. The SVM RBF performs very well on this task with a high accuracy.  

### MLP
__Architecture Selection__ : We initially started with the implementation of an MLP with a single hidden layer testing various combination of hidden size and learning rate. 
The best model (hidden dimension : 256, learning rate : 0.001), achieved a validation accuracy of 97.70%, which we considered as an acceptable baseline, but not enough. We decided to further explore the model’s potential and investigate how much the performance could be improved. For that reason, we proceeded to implement an MLP with two hidden layers.

__Layer and batch size selection__ : We performed a small grid search to identifying the optimal values for hyperparameters. Twelve configurations were tested. Results indicate that the smaller network (128–>64) generalizes better than the larger one (256–>128). Moreover, a batch size of 64 consistently produced the highest validation accuracy, regardless of the learning rate or layer configuration.

__Learning rate selection__ : Four different learning rates were tested while keeping all other hyperparameters constant: {hidden layers: [128, 64]; batch size: 64}. The learning rate of 0.009 achieved the highest validation accuracy with balanced training and validation performance, indicating optimal convergence speed and stability. To further improve generalization and reduce overfitting, we decided to add dropout (p = 0.2), L2 regularization and Early stopping.

__Best Configuration__ : {hidden layers: [128, 64]; learning rate: 0.009; batch size: 64; dropout: 0.2; L2: 1e-4}

__Model Evaluation__ : The final MLP model achieved 98.17% test accuracy on the dataset. This performance demonstrates that regularization (dropout + L2) and early stopping effectively reduced overfitting and improved the model. 

__Additional Experiments__ : Feature Transformation with Principle Component Analysis (PCA) 
Following our MLP implementation, we decided to apply a PCA prior to feeding the model. Our main idea was to test whether reducing the number of feature could improving the results.
We experimented with several number of components. Despite the fact we obtained relatively good results, but no accuracy improvements were found after applying PCA prior to training the model.

#### Results

![Confusion matrix](./MLP/confusion-matrix.png)

Test accuracy: 0.980

### CNN
We experimented with kernel size, number of convolutional layers, and learning rate.
The best-performing model used two convolutional layers, kernel size 5, and learning rate 0.001, achieving a validation accuracy of 99.18% and test accuracy of 99.24%.
Smaller kernels or lower learning rates slightly reduced accuracy, while a single-layer CNN underperformed.
The validation and test metrics were closely aligned, indicating good generalization and minimal overfitting.

Test accuracy: 0.992

__Discussion__ : On the MNIST dataset, adding more convolutional layers usually provides only very small improvements, because the images are simple, grayscale, and low-resolution. Two convolutional layers are already enough to capture the essential hierarchical features — from edges to digit shapes — and achieve test accuracies around 99 %. Deeper models can slightly increase accuracy (perhaps by 0.1 – 0.3 %) but at the cost of longer training times and a higher risk of overfitting, so ... worth trying?

## Summary

On the MNIST dataset, all three models — SVM, MLP, and CNN — achieved high performance. Table 1 provides a comparison of the final test accuracies obtained by the three classifiers

**Table 1 – Comparison of Classifier Performance**
| Model | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Key Hyperparameters |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| SVM (RBF) | - | 98.7% | C = 10, γ = 0.001 |
| MLP (2 hidden layers) | 98.11% | 98% | hidden layers = [128, 64], learning rate = 0.009, batch size = 64, dropout = 0.2, L2 regularization = 1e-4 |
| CNN (2 conv × 5×5) | 99.18 % | 99.24 % | kernel = 5, conv layers = 2, lr = 0.001, dropout = 0.25 |

The CNN achieved the highest accuracy, confirming the advantage of spatial feature extraction over the fully connected MLP and the kernel-based SVM for image data.
